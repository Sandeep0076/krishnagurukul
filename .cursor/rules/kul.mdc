Project: Krishna Gurukul School Website Revamp
Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), basic PHP (admin), JSON (data), Hostinger basic hosting

- Follow this directory structure:
/css/      – CSS files
/js/       – JavaScript files
/images/   – Image assets (school, events, etc.)
/php/      – PHP scripts (admin only)
/data/     – gallery.json
# Security & Performance
- All file uploads must be sanitized, with validation for type/size in PHP
- Admin endpoint uses HTTP Basic Auth, do NOT expose credentials in the repo
- Use HTTPS URLs for all resources
- Optimize all images to be <200KB, width ≤ 1200px
- Lazy-load images on gallery pages

# Accessibility & SEO
- Provide descriptive alt text for every image
- Use high-contrast colors for text/background (school palette: deep
